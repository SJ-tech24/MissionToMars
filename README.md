Story 1

-What went well

I was able to read and understand what the code did

I was able to get the light blinking



-What didn't go well

I am confused about what the round wire does



-What I'll do to understand it better

Look back on the course or research its purpose


Story 2

-What went well
 
I was able to get the lights to blink in a alternate pattern 

I made the circuit and could understand why it worked


-What didn't go well

I struggled making the variables work 


-What I'll do to understand it better

Read code more carefully

Story 3

-What went well

I was able to understand and write the code


-What didn't go well

Connecting the circuits and making it work


-What I'll do to understand it better

Check how the circuit loops


Story 4

-What went well

I was able to make the functions and give them a parameters for a delay time


-What didn't go well

Nothing :D


-What  I'll do to understand it better

I might try to experiment with what I can do with the parameters
