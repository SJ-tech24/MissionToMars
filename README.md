Story 1

-What went well

I was able to read and understand what the code did

I was able to get the light blinking



-What didn't go well

I am confused about what the round wire does



-What I'll do to understand it better

Look back on the course or research its purpose


Story 2

-What went well
 
I was able to get the lights to blink in a alternate pattern 

I made the circuit and could understand why it worked


-What didn't go well

I struggled making the variables work 


-What I'll do to understand it better

Read code more carefully
